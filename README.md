# Python-List-Level-2
In this level I Have learned about List and List Comprehension

In Python, a list is a versatile data structure that can hold a collection of items. Here's how you can represent a list in bullet points:
<ol>
<li> Lists are denoted by square brackets [ ].</li>
<Elements in a list are separated by commas.
Lists can contain items of different data types, such as integers, strings, or even other lists.
Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after creation.
You can access elements in a list using indexing, starting from 0 for the first element.
</ol>
